# 2004MakeConfig
Historical Archive of Perl scripts written in 2004 - Makeconfig

I wrote these scripts in aprox 2003-2004 for a previous employer.

From what I remember, this program would take a cisco router config template, and using the inputs and DNS generate a confiuration that
could then be pasted in to a new router.  I have to think that any sensitive info is long past useful so I have not removed anything
for historical reasons.
